# springclouddemo
This is an entry-level demo of Spring Cloud

This demo is learned by an online course.
You can learn something about Eureka, Feign, Ribbon, Hystrix, and Zuul.
It is an entry-level demo, so it's not enough to use it in your business project.

I hope this demo can help you for understanding Spring Cloud component.
